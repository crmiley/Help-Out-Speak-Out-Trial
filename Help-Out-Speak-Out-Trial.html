<h1>Help Out Speak Out</h1>
<p style="color:#483D8B;">Our Mission: We want people to pay more attention to the injustices in the world and know what they can do to create more justice. You can use this website to get ideas of things you can do to create more justice in your community, state, country, and world.</p>
<p style="color:#483D8B;">There are many injustices in the world. These include poverty, racial discrimination, wage gaps in the workplace, and anything that puts one person below another.</p>
